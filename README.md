# DIABETIS-DETECTION
1)Built a Diabetes Detection project using AIML 
2)In this project we have trained an algorithm in such a way that it can detect a person is diabetic or not, by the details given in the data set. 
3) Communicated with our team members for requirement gathering and understanding the workflow for testing and designing the algorithm.
